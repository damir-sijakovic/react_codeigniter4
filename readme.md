# REACT + CODEIGNITER4

## React and Codeigniter4 development setup example.

### Usage

Run 'install.sh' to install npm/composer dependencies.   
First start 'start_codeigniter.sh' script in one terminal window and    
start 'start_react.sh' script after that in another.   

This will start React at port 3000 and (through proxy) PHP development server at port 9777.

### Building Project

Close both server scripts and run 'build.sh'.    
This will compile everything into 'BACKENDBUILD' dir.   

### Requires 
Something with proper bash.  
Linux preferably.
